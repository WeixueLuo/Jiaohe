# The 54.12-ha large-scale observational site (LSOS) is located in the Jiaohe Management Bureau in Jilin Province, China. The area has a mean annual temperature of 3.8 °C and a mean annual precipitation of 695.9 mm. The hottest month is July with the average daily temperature of 21.7 °C, whereas the coldest month is January with the average daily temperature of -18.6 °C. The brown forest soil typical of the area has a rootable depth ranging between 20 and 100 cm. 
#  We completely surveyed both sites in two consecutive inventories: the first inventory was conducted in 2010 and the second in 2015. On both sites, each of all free-standing woody stems with a diameter at breast height (dbh) greater than 1 cm was georeferenced and tagged, and the species and dbh were measured on site. A total of 46,458 trees were tallied in 2010, and 44,564 trees were tallied in 2015.
